# Programming in Science - Assignment 3

This is the starter project for Programming in Science Assignment 3. Written in Python and tested with Pytest.

### Question(s)

1. **(15%)** File I/O - Writing and Reading from a Text File:
   
   - Write a function that takes a list of numbers, writes them to a text file, and then reads them back as a list of integers.

2. **(15%)** File I/O - Writing and Reading from a CSV File:

3. **(20%)** Reading an Array from a File:
   
   - Write a function that reads a space-separated array from a text file and returns it as a NumPy array.

4. **(20%)** Plotting Data with `plot()` and `show()`:
   
   - Write a function that takes a list of numbers and plots them as a line graph using `matplotlib`.

5. **(30%)** Density Plot:
   
   - Write a function that takes a dataset and generates a density plot using `matplotlib`.

Note: For questions 4 and 5, the test cases always show PASS. The solutions for those questions will be evaluated manually. **Make sure you take screenshots your plots for these questions and include them in your files.**
